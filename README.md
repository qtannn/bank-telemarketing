# Bank Telemarketing Campaign Case Study

## Context:
* The bank offers financial products like savings and current accounts, debit cards, credit cards, term deposits, and loans. To boost revenue, it runs targeted marketing campaigns for these products, aiming for cost-effective approaches that increase both revenue and profit.
* Recently, the bank conducted a telemarketing campaign promoting term deposits to strengthen long-term relationships with existing customers.

## Problem: 
* Even though the bank has implemented some campaigns to foster the opening of term deposits, the outcome was not positive. The previous campaigns fails to attract the desired number of customers with a meagre response rate. Hence, in this current campaign, the bank aims to increase to the number of people who are willing to open term deposit with at target telemarketing.
* To do so, they need to identify which customer groups have the greatest potential for targeting.

## Task to be done
* EDA and K-clustering will be used to examine the historical data and inform the decision-making process for targeted customers.
* The data is from direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were phone-call-based. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be (yes) or not (no) subscribed.

## Key insights uncovered: 
* Potential groups of target customers for the telemarketing campaign would be retired individuals, students, and unemployed people.
* Among them, people who achieve higher education status, such as tertiary and high school, have a higher likelihood of making a deposit.
* When making a phone call, the bank should try to make it 400 seconds long or more to ensure that the customers are well-informed about the product and its benefits so that they can be more persuaded.
