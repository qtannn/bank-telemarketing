# Bank Telemarketing Campaign Case Study

## Context:
* The bank offers financial products like savings and current accounts, debit cards, credit cards, term deposits, and loans. To boost revenue, it runs targeted marketing campaigns for these products, aiming for cost-effective approaches that increase both revenue and profit.
* Recently, the bank conducted a telemarketing campaign promoting term deposits to strengthen long-term relationships with existing customers.

## Problem: 
* Previous campaigns to encourage term deposit openings had low response rates, failing to attract the desired number of customers. In this campaign, the bank aims to increase the number of term deposit openings through targeted telemarketing.
* To achieve this, identifying customer segments with the highest potential for engagement is essential.

## Key techniques include:
* EDA to uncover trends and patterns
* K-Prototypes clustering for mixed data types (numerical and categorical)
* Identifying high-potential customer segments
* Strategic recommendations for improving telemarketing efforts

## Key insights uncovered: 
* Retired individuals, students, and unemployed people are promising target groups for the telemarketing campaign.
* Customers with higher education levels, particularly those with tertiary and high school education, show a greater likelihood of opening a term deposit.
* Phone calls should ideally last 400 seconds or more to effectively inform customers about the product, increasing the chance of conversion.
